# GPTfall

**GPTfall (SusPictions)** is a multiplayer, deception-based party game inspired by Spyfall. The objective is simple: identify the imposter! Players are given a specific idea within a broad topic, while one player (the imposter) is left in the dark. Through rounds of strategic questioning, players attempt to expose the imposter without revealing their own knowledge. It’s a game of bluff, deduction, and clever questions!

## Inspiration
The concept of this game was inspired by Spyfall, a popular party game that’s perfect for large groups. We wanted to create a digital, AI-enhanced version that players can enjoy from anywhere, making it accessible and full of new twists.
